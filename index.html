        <h2>About Birds</h2>
        <p>Birds are a diverse group of feathered, winged creatures found across the globe. 
            Known for their ability to fly, some species, like penguins and ostriches, are flightless. 
            They are warm-blooded vertebrates with lightweight skeletons, beaks, and a unique respiratory system. 
            Birds lay hard-shelled eggs and exhibit complex behaviors such as migration, nesting, and vocalization. 
            They play vital roles in ecosystems as pollinators, seed dispersers, and predators. 
            With over 10,000 species, birds range from tiny hummingbirds to large ostriches, 
            showcasing an incredible variety of colors, shapes, and sounds.</p>
        <h2>Birds and Humans</h2>
        <p>Birds have always fascinated humans, symbolizing freedom, peace, and beauty. 
            They inspire art, music, and science while playing essential roles in nature, 
            like pollination and pest control. Birdwatching offers a peaceful connection to nature, 
            reminding us of their importance. 
            Protecting birds helps preserve biodiversity and ensures a healthier planet for all.</p>
